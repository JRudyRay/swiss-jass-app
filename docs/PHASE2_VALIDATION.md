## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Socket.IO Event Validation

#### **`game:selectTrump` Handler** (`backend/src/index.ts` lines 271-335)

**Validations Added:**
- ✅ **Phase check** - Must be in `trump_selection` phase

- ✅ **Player membership** - User must be a player in the game
- ✅ **Turn order** - Must be current player's turn

**Error Codes:**
- `INVALID_PHASE` - Wrong game phase
- `UNAUTHENTICATED` - No token provided
- `NOT_IN_GAME` - User not a player
- `NOT_YOUR_TURN` - Wrong player attempting action
- `TRUMP_SELECTION_FAILED` - Server error

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Not your turn (current player: 2)",
  "code": "NOT_YOUR_TURN"
}
```

#### **`game:playCard` Handler** (`backend/src/index.ts` lines 337-420)

**Validations Added:**
- ✅ **Phase check** - Must be in `playing` phase
- ✅ **Authentication** - User must be logged in
- ✅ **Player membership** - User must be a player in the game
- ✅ **Turn order** - Must be current player's turn
- ✅ **Card legality** - Must be a legal card per Swiss Jass rules

**Error Codes:**
- `INVALID_PHASE` - Wrong game phase
- `UNAUTHENTICATED` - No token provided
- `NOT_IN_GAME` - User not a player
- `NOT_YOUR_TURN` - Wrong player's turn
- `ILLEGAL_CARD` - Card violates follow-suit rules
- `PLAY_REJECTED` - Engine rejected move

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Illegal card play (must follow suit or play trump)",
  "code": "ILLEGAL_CARD",
  "legalCards": ["eicheln_A", "eicheln_K", "eicheln_10"]
}
```

---

### 2. Table Lifecycle Guards

#### **`joinTable()` Validation** (`backend/src/services/tableService.ts` lines 95-121)

**Guards Added:**
- ✅ **Status check** - Only join tables with `status === 'OPEN'`
- ✅ **Capacity check** - Cannot exceed `maxPlayers` limit
- ✅ **Password check** - Private tables require correct password
- ✅ **Duplicate check** - User can't join twice

**Error Messages:**
```
"Table is not accepting new players (status: IN_PROGRESS)"
"Table is full (4/4 players)"
"Invalid table password"
```

---

#### **`startTable()` Validation** (`backend/src/services/tableService.ts` lines 124-149)

**Guards Added:**
- ✅ **Status check** - Cannot start non-OPEN tables
- ✅ **Minimum players** - Requires at least 2 players (1 human minimum)
- ✅ **Host authorization** - Only table host can start

**Error Messages:**
```
"Cannot start table in status 'IN_PROGRESS'"
"Cannot start game with only 1 player(s). Need at least 2."
"Only host can start"
```

## 🧪 Manual Test Script

### Test 1: Turn Order Validation

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Connect as Player 1
# Use Socket.IO client or frontend
# Attempt to play card when it's Player 2's turn
# Expected: Error "NOT_YOUR_TURN"
```

### Test 2: Illegal Card Rejection

```bash
# Play a card that doesn't follow suit
# Expected: Error "ILLEGAL_CARD" with legalCards array
```

### Test 3: Room Capacity

```bash
# Join a table with 4/4 players
# Expected: Error "Table is full (4/4 players)"
```

### Test 4: Start Table Guards

```bash
# Try starting a table with 1 player
# Expected: Error "Cannot start game with only 1 player(s)"

# Try starting as non-host
# Expected: Error "Only host can start"
```

## 📊 Validation Flow Diagram

```
Client: game:playCard event
         ↓
Server: Authenticate token
         ↓ (valid)
Server: Check game phase === 'playing'
         ↓ (pass)
Server: Map userId → playerIndex
         ↓ (found)
Server: Validate currentPlayer === playerIndex
         ↓ (pass)
Server: Get legal cards for player
         ↓
Server: Check if cardId in legalCards
         ↓ (pass)
Engine: playCard(cardId, playerIndex)
         ↓ (success)
Broadcast: game:state to all players
```
